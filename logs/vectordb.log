CHAPTER 9
•
THE TRANSFORMER
Here’s a summary of the main points that we covered:
• Transformers are non-recurrent networks based on multi-head attention, a
kind of self-attention. A multi-head attention computation takes an input
vector xi and maps it to an output ai by adding in vectors from prior tokens,
weighted by how relevant they are for the processing of the current word.
• A transformer block consists of a residual stream in which the input from
the prior layer is passed up to the next layer, with the output of different com-
ponents added to it. These components include a multi-head attention layer
followed by a feedforward layer, each preceded by layer normalizations.
Transformer blocks are stacked to make deeper and more powerful networks.
• The input to a transformer is computed by adding an embedding (computed
with an embedding matrix) to a positional encoding that represents the se-
quential position of the token in the window.
• Language models can be built out of stacks of transformer blocks, with a
language model head at the top, which applies an unembedding matrix to
the output H of the top layer to generate the logits, which are then passed
through a softmax to generate word probabilities.
• Transformer-based language models have a wide context window (200K to-
kens or even more for very large models with special mechanisms) allowing
them to draw on enormous amounts of context to predict upcoming words.
Bibliographical and Historical Notes
The transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) was developed drawing on two lines of prior
research: self-attention and memory networks.
Encoder-decoder attention, the idea of using a soft weighting over the encodings
of input words to inform a generative decoder (see Chapter 13) was developed by
Graves (2013) in the context of handwriting generation, and Bahdanau et al. (2015)
for MT. This idea was extended to self-attention by dropping the need for separate
encoding and decoding sequences and instead seeing attention as a way of weighting
the tokens in collecting information passed from lower layers to higher layers (Ling
et al., 2015; Cheng et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016).
Other aspects of the transformer, including the terminology of key, query, and
value, came from memory networks, a mechanism for adding an external read-
write memory to networks, by using an embedding of a query to match keys rep-
resenting content in an associative memory (Sukhbaatar et al., 2015; Weston et al.,
2015; Graves et al., 2014).

the best previous backgammon computer programs. Adding specialized backgammon
features produced TD-Gammon 1.0 which was substantially better than all previous
backgammon programs and competed well against human experts.
Mnih et al. developed a reinforcement learning agent called deep Q-network (DQN)
that combined Q-learning with a deep convolutional ANN, a many-layered, or deep,
ANN specialized for processing spatial arrays of data such as images. We describe deep
convolutional ANNs in Section 9.6. By the time of Mnih et al.’s work with DQN, deep
ANNs, including deep convolutional ANNs, had produced impressive results in many
applications, but they had not been widely used in reinforcement learning.
Mnih et al. used DQN to show how a reinforcement learning agent can achieve a high
level of performance on any of a collection of di↵erent problems without having to use
di↵erent problem-speciﬁc feature sets. To demonstrate this, they let DQN learn to play
49 di↵erent Atari 2600 video games by interacting with a game emulator. DQN learned a
di↵erent policy for each of the 49 games (because the weights of its ANN were reset to
random values before learning on each game), but it used the same raw input, network
architecture, and parameter values (e.g., step size, discount rate, exploration parameters,
and many more speciﬁc to the implementation) for all the games. DQN achieved levels
of play at or beyond human level on a large fraction of these games. Although the games
were alike in being played by watching streams of video images, they varied widely in other
respects. Their actions had di↵erent e↵ects, they had di↵erent state-transition dynamics,
and they needed di↵erent policies for learning high scores. The deep convolutional ANN
learned to transform the raw input common to all the games into features specialized for
representing the action values required for playing at the high level DQN achieved for
most of the games.
The Atari 2600 is a home video game console that was sold in various versions by Atari
Inc. from 1977 to 1992. It introduced or popularized many arcade video games that are
now considered classics, such as Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, and Asteroids. Although
much simpler than modern video games, Atari 2600 games are still entertaining and
challenging for human players, and they have been attractive as testbeds for developing
and evaluating reinforcement learning methods (Diuk, Cohen, Littman, 2008; Naddaf,
2010; Cobo, Zang, Isbell, and Thomaz, 2011; Bellemare, Veness, and Bowling, 2013).
Bellemare, Naddaf, Veness, and Bowling (2012) developed the publicly available Arcade
Learning Environment (ALE) to encourage and simplify using Atari 2600 games to study
learning and planning algorithms.
These previous studies and the availability of ALE made the Atari 2600 game collection
a good choice for Mnih et al.’s demonstration, which was also inﬂuenced by the impressive
human-level performance that TD-Gammon was able to achieve in backgammon. DQN
is similar to TD-Gammon in using a multi-layer ANN as the function approximation
method for a semi-gradient form of a TD algorithm, with the gradients computed by
the backpropagation algorithm. However, instead of using TD(λ) as TD-Gammon did,
DQN used the semi-gradient form of Q-learning. TD-Gammon estimated the values of
afterstates, which were easily obtained from the rules for making backgammon moves.
To use the same algorithm for the Atari games would have required generating the next
states for each possible action (which would not have been afterstates in that case).

A ﬁnal modiﬁcation of standard Q-learning was also found to improve stability. They
clipped the error term Rt+1 + γ maxa ˜q(St+1, a, wt) −ˆq(St, At, wt) so that it remained in
the interval [−1, 1].
Mnih et al. conducted a large number of learning runs on 5 of the games to gain insight
into the e↵ect that various of DQN’s design features had on its performance. They ran
DQN with the four combinations of experience replay and the duplicate target network
being included or not included. Although the results varied from game to game, each of
these features alone signiﬁcantly improved performance, and very dramatically improved
performance when used together. Mnih et al. also studied the role played by the deep
convolutional ANN in DQN’s learning ability by comparing the deep convolutional version
of DQN with a version having a network of just one linear layer, both receiving the same
stacked preprocessed video frames. Here, the improvement of the deep convolutional
version over the linear version was particularly striking across all 5 of the test games.
Creating artiﬁcial agents that excel over a diverse collection of challenging tasks has
been an enduring goal of artiﬁcial intelligence. The promise of machine learning as
a means for achieving this has been frustrated by the need to craft problem-speciﬁc
representations. DeepMind’s DQN stands as a major step forward by demonstrating
that a single agent can learn problem-speciﬁc features enabling it to acquire human-
competitive skills over a range of tasks. This demonstration did not produce one agent
that simultaneously excelled at all the tasks (because learning occurred separately for
each task), but it showed that deep learning can reduce, and possibly eliminate, the need
for problem-speciﬁc design and tuning. As Mnih et al. point out, however, DQN is not
a complete solution to the problem of task-independent learning. Although the skills
needed to excel on the Atari games were markedly diverse, all the games were played by
observing video images, which made a deep convolutional ANN a natural choice for this
collection of tasks. In addition, DQN’s performance on some of the Atari 2600 games
fell considerably short of human skill levels on these games. The games most diﬃcult
for DQN—especially Montezuma’s Revenge on which DQN learned to perform about as
well as the random player—require deep planning beyond what DQN was designed to
do. Further, learning control skills through extensive practice, like DQN learned how to
play the Atari games, is just one of the types of learning humans routinely accomplish.
Despite these limitations, DQN advanced the state-of-the-art in machine learning by
impressively demonstrating the promise of combining reinforcement learning with modern
methods of deep learning.

Mastering the Game of Go
The ancient Chinese game of Go has challenged artiﬁcial intelligence researchers for many
decades. Methods that achieve human-level skill, or even superhuman-level skill, in other
games have not been successful in producing strong Go programs. Thanks to a very
active community of Go programmers and international competitions, the level of Go
program play has improved signiﬁcantly over the years. Until recently, however, no Go
program had been able to play anywhere near the level of a human Go master.
A team at DeepMind (Silver et al., 2016) developed the program AlphaGo that broke

games. No game-speciﬁc prior knowledge was involved beyond the general understanding
that it should still be possible to learn good policies with this reduced dimension and
that stacking adjacent frames should help with the partial observability of some of the
games. Because no game-speciﬁc prior knowledge beyond this minimal amount was used
in preprocessing the image frames, we can think of the 84⇥84⇥4 input vectors as being
“raw” input to DQN.
The basic architecture of DQN is similar to the deep convolutional ANN illustrated in
Figure 9.15 (though unlike that network, subsampling in DQN is treated as part of each
convolutional layer, with feature maps consisting of units having only a selection of the
possible receptive ﬁelds). DQN has three hidden convolutional layers, followed by one
fully connected hidden layer, followed by the output layer. The three successive hidden
convolutional layers of DQN produce 32 20⇥20 feature maps, 64 9⇥9 feature maps,
and 64 7⇥7 feature maps. The activation function of the units of each feature map is a
rectiﬁer nonlinearity (max(0, x)). The 3,136 (64⇥7⇥7) units in this third convolutional
layer all connect to each of 512 units in the fully connected hidden layer, which then each
connect to all 18 units in the output layer, one for each possible action in an Atari game.
The activation levels of DQN’s output units were the estimated optimal action values
of the corresponding state–action pairs, for the state represented by the network’s input.
The assignment of output units to a game’s actions varied from game to game, and
because the number of valid actions varied between 4 and 18 for the games, not all output
units had functional roles in all of the games. It helps to think of the network as if it
were 18 separate networks, one for estimating the optimal action value of each possible
action. In reality, these networks shared their initial layers, but the output units learned
to use the features extracted by these layers in di↵erent ways.
DQN’s reward signal indicated how a games’s score changed from one time step to
the next: +1 whenever it increased, −1 whenever it decreased, and 0 otherwise. This
standardized the reward signal across the games and made a single step-size parameter
work well for all the games despite their varying ranges of scores. DQN used an "-greedy
policy, with " decreasing linearly over the ﬁrst million frames and remaining at a low
value for the rest of the learning session. The values of the various other parameters,
such as the learning step size, discount rate, and others speciﬁc to the implementation,
were selected by performing informal searches to see which values worked best for a small
selection of the games. These values were then held ﬁxed for all of the games.
After DQN selected an action, the action was executed by the game emulator, which
returned a reward and the next video frame. The frame was preprocessed and added
to the four-frame stack that became the next input to the network. Skipping for the
moment the changes to the basic Q-learning procedure made by Mnih et al., DQN used
the following semi-gradient form of Q-learning to update the network’s weights:
wt+1 = wt + ↵
h
Rt+1 + γ max
a
ˆq(St+1, a, wt) −ˆq(St, At, wt)
i
rˆq(St, At, wt), (16.3)
where wt is the vector of the network’s weights, At is the action selected at time step t,
and St and St+1 are respectively the preprocessed image stacks input to the network at
time steps t and t + 1.
The gradient in (16.3) was computed by backpropagation. Imagining again that there

features produced TD-Gammon 1.0 which was substantially better than all previous
backgammon programs and competed well against human experts.
Mnih et al. developed a reinforcement learning agent called deep Q-network (DQN)
that combined Q-learning with a deep convolutional ANN, a many-layered, or deep,
ANN specialized for processing spatial arrays of data such as images. We describe deep
convolutional ANNs in Section 9.6. By the time of Mnih et al.’s work with DQN, deep
ANNs, including deep convolutional ANNs, had produced impressive results in many
applications, but they had not been widely used in reinforcement learning.
Mnih et al. used DQN to show how a reinforcement learning agent can achieve a high
level of performance on any of a collection of di↵erent problems without having to use
di↵erent problem-speciﬁc feature sets. To demonstrate this, they let DQN learn to play
49 di↵erent Atari 2600 video games by interacting with a game emulator. DQN learned a
di↵erent policy for each of the 49 games (because the weights of its ANN were reset to
random values before learning on each game), but it used the same raw input, network
architecture, and parameter values (e.g., step size, discount rate, exploration parameters,
and many more speciﬁc to the implementation) for all the games. DQN achieved levels
of play at or beyond human level on a large fraction of these games. Although the games
were alike in being played by watching streams of video images, they varied widely in other
respects. Their actions had di↵erent e↵ects, they had di↵erent state-transition dynamics,
and they needed di↵erent policies for learning high scores. The deep convolutional ANN
learned to transform the raw input common to all the games into features specialized for
representing the action values required for playing at the high level DQN achieved for
most of the games.

active community of Go programmers and international competitions, the level of Go
program play has improved signiﬁcantly over the years. Until recently, however, no Go
program had been able to play anywhere near the level of a human Go master.
A team at DeepMind (Silver et al., 2016) developed the program AlphaGo that broke

games. No game-speciﬁc prior knowledge was involved beyond the general understanding
that it should still be possible to learn good policies with this reduced dimension and
that stacking adjacent frames should help with the partial observability of some of the
games. Because no game-speciﬁc prior knowledge beyond this minimal amount was used
in preprocessing the image frames, we can think of the 84⇥84⇥4 input vectors as being
“raw” input to DQN.
The basic architecture of DQN is similar to the deep convolutional ANN illustrated in
Figure 9.15 (though unlike that network, subsampling in DQN is treated as part of each
convolutional layer, with feature maps consisting of units having only a selection of the
possible receptive ﬁelds). DQN has three hidden convolutional layers, followed by one
fully connected hidden layer, followed by the output layer. The three successive hidden
convolutional layers of DQN produce 32 20⇥20 feature maps, 64 9⇥9 feature maps,
and 64 7⇥7 feature maps. The activation function of the units of each feature map is a
rectiﬁer nonlinearity (max(0, x)). The 3,136 (64⇥7⇥7) units in this third convolutional
layer all connect to each of 512 units in the fully connected hidden layer, which then each
connect to all 18 units in the output layer, one for each possible action in an Atari game.
The activation levels of DQN’s output units were the estimated optimal action values
of the corresponding state–action pairs, for the state represented by the network’s input.
The assignment of output units to a game’s actions varied from game to game, and
because the number of valid actions varied between 4 and 18 for the games, not all output
units had functional roles in all of the games. It helps to think of the network as if it
were 18 separate networks, one for estimating the optimal action value of each possible
action. In reality, these networks shared their initial layers, but the output units learned
to use the features extracted by these layers in di↵erent ways.
DQN’s reward signal indicated how a games’s score changed from one time step to
the next: +1 whenever it increased, −1 whenever it decreased, and 0 otherwise. This
standardized the reward signal across the games and made a single step-size parameter
work well for all the games despite their varying ranges of scores. DQN used an "-greedy
policy, with " decreasing linearly over the ﬁrst million frames and remaining at a low
value for the rest of the learning session. The values of the various other parameters,
such as the learning step size, discount rate, and others speciﬁc to the implementation,
were selected by performing informal searches to see which values worked best for a small
selection of the games. These values were then held ﬁxed for all of the games.
After DQN selected an action, the action was executed by the game emulator, which
returned a reward and the next video frame. The frame was preprocessed and added
to the four-frame stack that became the next input to the network. Skipping for the
moment the changes to the basic Q-learning procedure made by Mnih et al., DQN used
the following semi-gradient form of Q-learning to update the network’s weights:
wt+1 = wt + ↵
h
Rt+1 + γ max
a
ˆq(St+1, a, wt) −ˆq(St, At, wt)
i
rˆq(St, At, wt), (16.3)
where wt is the vector of the network’s weights, At is the action selected at time step t,
and St and St+1 are respectively the preprocessed image stacks input to the network at
time steps t and t + 1.
The gradient in (16.3) was computed by backpropagation. Imagining again that there

the best previous backgammon computer programs. Adding specialized backgammon
features produced TD-Gammon 1.0 which was substantially better than all previous
backgammon programs and competed well against human experts.
Mnih et al. developed a reinforcement learning agent called deep Q-network (DQN)
that combined Q-learning with a deep convolutional ANN, a many-layered, or deep,
ANN specialized for processing spatial arrays of data such as images. We describe deep
convolutional ANNs in Section 9.6. By the time of Mnih et al.’s work with DQN, deep
ANNs, including deep convolutional ANNs, had produced impressive results in many
applications, but they had not been widely used in reinforcement learning.
Mnih et al. used DQN to show how a reinforcement learning agent can achieve a high
level of performance on any of a collection of di↵erent problems without having to use
di↵erent problem-speciﬁc feature sets. To demonstrate this, they let DQN learn to play
49 di↵erent Atari 2600 video games by interacting with a game emulator. DQN learned a
di↵erent policy for each of the 49 games (because the weights of its ANN were reset to
random values before learning on each game), but it used the same raw input, network
architecture, and parameter values (e.g., step size, discount rate, exploration parameters,
and many more speciﬁc to the implementation) for all the games. DQN achieved levels
of play at or beyond human level on a large fraction of these games. Although the games
were alike in being played by watching streams of video images, they varied widely in other
respects. Their actions had di↵erent e↵ects, they had di↵erent state-transition dynamics,
and they needed di↵erent policies for learning high scores. The deep convolutional ANN
learned to transform the raw input common to all the games into features specialized for
representing the action values required for playing at the high level DQN achieved for
most of the games.
The Atari 2600 is a home video game console that was sold in various versions by Atari
Inc. from 1977 to 1992. It introduced or popularized many arcade video games that are
now considered classics, such as Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, and Asteroids. Although
much simpler than modern video games, Atari 2600 games are still entertaining and
challenging for human players, and they have been attractive as testbeds for developing
and evaluating reinforcement learning methods (Diuk, Cohen, Littman, 2008; Naddaf,
2010; Cobo, Zang, Isbell, and Thomaz, 2011; Bellemare, Veness, and Bowling, 2013).
Bellemare, Naddaf, Veness, and Bowling (2012) developed the publicly available Arcade
Learning Environment (ALE) to encourage and simplify using Atari 2600 games to study
learning and planning algorithms.
These previous studies and the availability of ALE made the Atari 2600 game collection
a good choice for Mnih et al.’s demonstration, which was also inﬂuenced by the impressive
human-level performance that TD-Gammon was able to achieve in backgammon. DQN
is similar to TD-Gammon in using a multi-layer ANN as the function approximation
method for a semi-gradient form of a TD algorithm, with the gradients computed by
the backpropagation algorithm. However, instead of using TD(λ) as TD-Gammon did,
DQN used the semi-gradient form of Q-learning. TD-Gammon estimated the values of
afterstates, which were easily obtained from the rules for making backgammon moves.
To use the same algorithm for the Atari games would have required generating the next
states for each possible action (which would not have been afterstates in that case).

A ﬁnal modiﬁcation of standard Q-learning was also found to improve stability. They
clipped the error term Rt+1 + γ maxa ˜q(St+1, a, wt) −ˆq(St, At, wt) so that it remained in
the interval [−1, 1].
Mnih et al. conducted a large number of learning runs on 5 of the games to gain insight
into the e↵ect that various of DQN’s design features had on its performance. They ran
DQN with the four combinations of experience replay and the duplicate target network
being included or not included. Although the results varied from game to game, each of
these features alone signiﬁcantly improved performance, and very dramatically improved
performance when used together. Mnih et al. also studied the role played by the deep
convolutional ANN in DQN’s learning ability by comparing the deep convolutional version
of DQN with a version having a network of just one linear layer, both receiving the same
stacked preprocessed video frames. Here, the improvement of the deep convolutional
version over the linear version was particularly striking across all 5 of the test games.
Creating artiﬁcial agents that excel over a diverse collection of challenging tasks has
been an enduring goal of artiﬁcial intelligence. The promise of machine learning as
a means for achieving this has been frustrated by the need to craft problem-speciﬁc
representations. DeepMind’s DQN stands as a major step forward by demonstrating
that a single agent can learn problem-speciﬁc features enabling it to acquire human-
competitive skills over a range of tasks. This demonstration did not produce one agent
that simultaneously excelled at all the tasks (because learning occurred separately for
each task), but it showed that deep learning can reduce, and possibly eliminate, the need
for problem-speciﬁc design and tuning. As Mnih et al. point out, however, DQN is not
a complete solution to the problem of task-independent learning. Although the skills
needed to excel on the Atari games were markedly diverse, all the games were played by
observing video images, which made a deep convolutional ANN a natural choice for this
collection of tasks. In addition, DQN’s performance on some of the Atari 2600 games
fell considerably short of human skill levels on these games. The games most diﬃcult
for DQN—especially Montezuma’s Revenge on which DQN learned to perform about as
well as the random player—require deep planning beyond what DQN was designed to
do. Further, learning control skills through extensive practice, like DQN learned how to
play the Atari games, is just one of the types of learning humans routinely accomplish.
Despite these limitations, DQN advanced the state-of-the-art in machine learning by
impressively demonstrating the promise of combining reinforcement learning with modern
methods of deep learning.
