Human-level Video Game Play\n437\nthe best previous backgammon computer programs. Adding specialized backgammon\nfeatures produced TD-Gammon 1.0 which was substantially better than all previous\nbackgammon programs and competed well against human experts.\nMnih et al. developed a reinforcement learning agent called deep Q-network (DQN)\nthat combined Q-learning with a deep convolutional ANN, a many-layered, or deep,\nANN specialized for processing spatial arrays of data such as images. We describe deep\nconvolutional ANNs in Section 9.6. By the time of Mnih et al.\u2019s work with DQN, deep\nANNs, including deep convolutional ANNs, had produced impressive results in many\napplications, but they had not been widely used in reinforcement learning.\nMnih et al. used DQN to show how a reinforcement learning agent can achieve a high\nlevel of performance on any of a collection of di\u21b5erent problems without having to use\ndi\u21b5erent problem-speci\ufb01c feature sets. To demonstrate this, they let DQN learn to play\n49 di\u21b5erent Atari 2600 video games by interacting with a game emulator. DQN learned a\ndi\u21b5erent policy for each of the 49 games (because the weights of its ANN were reset to\nrandom values before learning on each game), but it used the same raw input, network\narchitecture, and parameter values (e.g., step size, discount rate, exploration parameters,\nand many more speci\ufb01c to the implementation) for all the games. DQN achieved levels\nof play at or beyond human level on a large fraction of these games. Although the games\nwere alike in being played by watching streams of video images, they varied widely in other\nrespects. Their actions had di\u21b5erent e\u21b5ects, they had di\u21b5erent state-transition dynamics,\nand they needed di\u21b5erent policies for learning high scores. The deep convolutional ANN\nlearned to transform the raw input common to all the games into features specialized for\nrepresenting the action values required for playing at the high level DQN achieved for\nmost of the games.\nThe Atari 2600 is a home video game console that was sold in various versions by Atari\nInc. from 1977 to 1992. It introduced or popularized many arcade video games that are\nnow considered classics, such as Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, and Asteroids. Although\nmuch simpler than modern video games, Atari 2600 games are still entertaining and\nchallenging for human players, and they have been attractive as testbeds for developing\nand evaluating reinforcement learning methods (Diuk, Cohen, Littman, 2008; Naddaf,\n2010; Cobo, Zang, Isbell, and Thomaz, 2011; Bellemare, Veness, and Bowling, 2013).\nBellemare, Naddaf, Veness, and Bowling (2012) developed the publicly available Arcade\nLearning Environment (ALE) to encourage and simplify using Atari 2600 games to study\nlearning and planning algorithms.\nThese previous studies and the availability of ALE made the Atari 2600 game collection\na good choice for Mnih et al.\u2019s demonstration, which was also in\ufb02uenced by the impressive\nhuman-level performance that TD-Gammon was able to achieve in backgammon.

Although the results varied from game to game, each of\nthese features alone signi\ufb01cantly improved performance, and very dramatically improved\nperformance when used together. Mnih et al. also studied the role played by the deep\nconvolutional ANN in DQN\u2019s learning ability by comparing the deep convolutional version\nof DQN with a version having a network of just one linear layer, both receiving the same\nstacked preprocessed video frames. Here, the improvement of the deep convolutional\nversion over the linear version was particularly striking across all 5 of the test games.\nCreating arti\ufb01cial agents that excel over a diverse collection of challenging tasks has\nbeen an enduring goal of arti\ufb01cial intelligence. The promise of machine learning as\na means for achieving this has been frustrated by the need to craft problem-speci\ufb01c\nrepresentations. DeepMind\u2019s DQN stands as a major step forward by demonstrating\nthat a single agent can learn problem-speci\ufb01c features enabling it to acquire human-\ncompetitive skills over a range of tasks. This demonstration did not produce one agent\nthat simultaneously excelled at all the tasks (because learning occurred separately for\neach task), but it showed that deep learning can reduce, and possibly eliminate, the need\nfor problem-speci\ufb01c design and tuning. As Mnih et al. point out, however, DQN is not\na complete solution to the problem of task-independent learning. Although the skills\nneeded to excel on the Atari games were markedly diverse, all the games were played by\nobserving video images, which made a deep convolutional ANN a natural choice for this\ncollection of tasks. In addition, DQN\u2019s performance on some of the Atari 2600 games\nfell considerably short of human skill levels on these games. The games most di\ufb03cult\nfor DQN\u2014especially Montezuma\u2019s Revenge on which DQN learned to perform about as\nwell as the random player\u2014require deep planning beyond what DQN was designed to\ndo. Further, learning control skills through extensive practice, like DQN learned how to\nplay the Atari games, is just one of the types of learning humans routinely accomplish.\nDespite these limitations, DQN advanced the state-of-the-art in machine learning by\nimpressively demonstrating the promise of combining reinforcement learning with modern\nmethods of deep learning.\n16.6\nMastering the Game of Go\nThe ancient Chinese game of Go has challenged arti\ufb01cial intelligence researchers for many\ndecades. Methods that achieve human-level skill, or even superhuman-level skill, in other\ngames have not been successful in producing strong Go programs. Thanks to a very\nactive community of Go programmers and international competitions, the level of Go\nprogram play has improved signi\ufb01cantly over the years. Until recently, however, no Go\nprogram had been able to play anywhere near the level of a human Go master.\nA team at DeepMind (Silver et al., 2016) developed the program AlphaGo that broke\n\n16.5. Human-level Video Game Play\n439\ngames. No game-speci\ufb01c prior knowledge was involved beyond the general understanding\nthat it should still be possible to learn good policies with this reduced dimension and\nthat stacking adjacent frames should help with the partial observability of some of the\ngames. Because no game-speci\ufb01c prior knowledge beyond this minimal amount was used\nin preprocessing the image frames, we can think of the 84\u21e584\u21e54 input vectors as being\n\u201craw\u201d input to DQN.\nThe basic architecture of DQN is similar to the deep convolutional ANN illustrated in\nFigure 9.15 (though unlike that network, subsampling in DQN is treated as part of each\nconvolutional layer, with feature maps consisting of units having only a selection of the\npossible receptive \ufb01elds). DQN has three hidden convolutional layers, followed by one\nfully connected hidden layer, followed by the output layer. The three successive hidden\nconvolutional layers of DQN produce 32 20\u21e520 feature maps, 64 9\u21e59 feature maps,\nand 64 7\u21e57 feature maps. The activation function of the units of each feature map is a\nrecti\ufb01er nonlinearity (max(0, x)). The 3,136 (64\u21e57\u21e57) units in this third convolutional\nlayer all connect to each of 512 units in the fully connected hidden layer, which then each\nconnect to all 18 units in the output layer, one for each possible action in an Atari game.\nThe activation levels of DQN\u2019s output units were the estimated optimal action values\nof the corresponding state\u2013action pairs, for the state represented by the network\u2019s input.\nThe assignment of output units to a game\u2019s actions varied from game to game, and\nbecause the number of valid actions varied between 4 and 18 for the games, not all output\nunits had functional roles in all of the games. It helps to think of the network as if it\nwere 18 separate networks, one for estimating the optimal action value of each possible\naction. In reality, these networks shared their initial layers, but the output units learned\nto use the features extracted by these layers in di\u21b5erent ways.\nDQN\u2019s reward signal indicated how a games\u2019s score changed from one time step to\nthe next: +1 whenever it increased, \u22121 whenever it decreased, and 0 otherwise. This\nstandardized the reward signal across the games and made a single step-size parameter\nwork well for all the games despite their varying ranges of scores. DQN used an \"-greedy\npolicy, with \" decreasing linearly over the \ufb01rst million frames and remaining at a low\nvalue for the rest of the learning session. The values of the various other parameters,\nsuch as the learning step size, discount rate, and others speci\ufb01c to the implementation,\nwere selected by performing informal searches to see which values worked best for a small\nselection of the games. These values were then held \ufb01xed for all of the games.\nAfter DQN selected an action, the action was executed by the game emulator, which\nreturned a reward and the next video frame. The frame was preprocessed and added\nto the four-frame stack that became the next input to the network. Skipping for the\nmoment the changes to the basic Q-learning procedure made by Mnih et al., DQN used\nthe following semi-gradient form of Q-learning to update the network\u2019s weights:\nwt+1 = wt + \u21b5\nh\nRt+1 + \u03b3 max\na\n\u02c6q(St+1, a, wt) \u2212\u02c6q(St, At, wt)\ni\nr\u02c6q(St, At, wt), (16.3)\nwhere wt is the vector of the network\u2019s weights, At is the action selected at time step t,\nand St and St+1 are respectively the preprocessed image stacks input to the network at\ntime steps t and t + 1.\nThe gradient in (16.3) was computed by backpropagation.

It introduced or popularized many arcade video games that are\nnow considered classics, such as Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, and Asteroids.

Their actions had di\u21b5erent e\u21b5ects, they had di\u21b5erent state-transition dynamics,\nand they needed di\u21b5erent policies for learning high scores. The deep convolutional ANN\nlearned to transform the raw input common to all the games into features specialized for\nrepresenting the action values required for playing at the high level DQN achieved for\nmost of the games.\nThe Atari 2600 is a home video game console that was sold in various versions by Atari\nInc. from 1977 to 1992. It introduced or popularized many arcade video games that are\nnow considered classics, such as Pong, Breakout, Space Invaders, and Asteroids. Although\nmuch simpler than modern video games, Atari 2600 games are still entertaining and\nchallenging for human players, and they have been attractive as testbeds for developing\nand evaluating reinforcement learning methods (Diuk, Cohen, Littman, 2008; Naddaf,\n2010; Cobo, Zang, Isbell, and Thomaz, 2011; Bellemare, Veness, and Bowling, 2013).\nBellemare, Naddaf, Veness, and Bowling (2012) developed the publicly available Arcade\nLearning Environment (ALE) to encourage and simplify using Atari 2600 games to study\nlearning and planning algorithms.\nThese previous studies and the availability of ALE made the Atari 2600 game collection\na good choice for Mnih et al.\u2019s demonstration, which was also in\ufb02uenced by the impressive\nhuman-level performance that TD-Gammon was able to achieve in backgammon. DQN\nis similar to TD-Gammon in using a multi-layer ANN as the function approximation\nmethod for a semi-gradient form of a TD algorithm, with the gradients computed by\nthe backpropagation algorithm. However, instead of using TD(\u03bb) as TD-Gammon did,\nDQN used the semi-gradient form of Q-learning. TD-Gammon estimated the values of\nafterstates, which were easily obtained from the rules for making backgammon moves.\nTo use the same algorithm for the Atari games would have required generating the next\nstates for each possible action (which would not have been afterstates in that case).\n\n16.6. Mastering the Game of Go\n441\nA \ufb01nal modi\ufb01cation of standard Q-learning was also found to improve stability. They\nclipped the error term Rt+1 + \u03b3 maxa \u02dcq(St+1, a, wt) \u2212\u02c6q(St, At, wt) so that it remained in\nthe interval [\u22121, 1].\nMnih et al. conducted a large number of learning runs on 5 of the games to gain insight\ninto the e\u21b5ect that various of DQN\u2019s design features had on its performance. They ran\nDQN with the four combinations of experience replay and the duplicate target network\nbeing included or not included. Although the results varied from game to game, each of\nthese features alone signi\ufb01cantly improved performance, and very dramatically improved\nperformance when used together. Mnih et al. also studied the role played by the deep\nconvolutional ANN in DQN\u2019s learning ability by comparing the deep convolutional version\nof DQN with a version having a network of just one linear layer, both receiving the same\nstacked preprocessed video frames. Here, the improvement of the deep convolutional\nversion over the linear version was particularly striking across all 5 of the test games.\nCreating arti\ufb01cial agents that excel over a diverse collection of challenging tasks has\nbeen an enduring goal of arti\ufb01cial intelligence. The promise of machine learning as\na means for achieving this has been frustrated by the need to craft problem-speci\ufb01c\nrepresentations. DeepMind\u2019s DQN stands as a major step forward by demonstrating\nthat a single agent can learn problem-speci\ufb01c features enabling it to acquire human-\ncompetitive skills over a range of tasks. This demonstration did not produce one agent\nthat simultaneously excelled at all the tasks (because learning occurred separately for\neach task), but it showed that deep learning can reduce, and possibly eliminate, the need\nfor problem-speci\ufb01c design and tuning. As Mnih et al. point out, however, DQN is not\na complete solution to the problem of task-independent learning. Although the skills\nneeded to excel on the Atari games were markedly diverse, all the games were played by\nobserving video images, which made a deep convolutional ANN a natural choice for this\ncollection of tasks. In addition, DQN\u2019s performance on some of the Atari 2600 games\nfell considerably short of human skill levels on these games. The games most di\ufb03cult\nfor DQN\u2014especially Montezuma\u2019s Revenge on which DQN learned to perform about as\nwell as the random player\u2014require deep planning beyond what DQN was designed to\ndo. Further, learning control skills through extensive practice, like DQN learned how to\nplay the Atari games, is just one of the types of learning humans routinely accomplish.\nDespite these limitations, DQN advanced the state-of-the-art in machine learning by\nimpressively demonstrating the promise of combining reinforcement learning with modern\nmethods of deep learning.\n16.6\nMastering the Game of Go\nThe ancient Chinese game of Go has challenged arti\ufb01cial intelligence researchers for many\ndecades. Methods that achieve human-level skill, or even superhuman-level skill, in other\ngames have not been successful in producing strong Go programs. Thanks to a very\nactive community of Go programmers and international competitions, the level of Go\nprogram play has improved signi\ufb01cantly over the years. Until recently, however, no Go\nprogram had been able to play anywhere near the level of a human Go master.\nA team at DeepMind (Silver et al., 2016) developed the program AlphaGo that broke\n\n16.5. Human-level Video Game Play\n439\ngames. No game-speci\ufb01c prior knowledge was involved beyond the general understanding\nthat it should still be possible to learn good policies with this reduced dimension and\nthat stacking adjacent frames should help with the partial observability of some of the\ngames. Because no game-speci\ufb01c prior knowledge beyond this minimal amount was used\nin preprocessing the image frames, we can think of the 84\u21e584\u21e54 input vectors as being\n\u201craw\u201d input to DQN.\nThe basic architecture of DQN is similar to the deep convolutional ANN illustrated in\nFigure 9.15 (though unlike that network, subsampling in DQN is treated as part of each\nconvolutional layer, with feature maps consisting of units having only a selection of the\npossible receptive \ufb01elds). DQN has three hidden convolutional layers, followed by one\nfully connected hidden layer, followed by the output layer. The three successive hidden\nconvolutional layers of DQN produce 32 20\u21e520 feature maps, 64 9\u21e59 feature maps,\nand 64 7\u21e57 feature maps. The activation function of the units of each feature map is a\nrecti\ufb01er nonlinearity (max(0, x)). The 3,136 (64\u21e57\u21e57) units in this third convolutional\nlayer all connect to each of 512 units in the fully connected hidden layer, which then each\nconnect to all 18 units in the output layer, one for each possible action in an Atari game.\nThe activation levels of DQN\u2019s output units were the estimated optimal action values\nof the corresponding state\u2013action pairs, for the state represented by the network\u2019s input.\nThe assignment of output units to a game\u2019s actions varied from game to game, and\nbecause the number of valid actions varied between 4 and 18 for the games, not all output\nunits had functional roles in all of the games. It helps to think of the network as if it\nwere 18 separate networks, one for estimating the optimal action value of each possible\naction. In reality, these networks shared their initial layers, but the output units learned\nto use the features extracted by these layers in di\u21b5erent ways.\nDQN\u2019s reward signal indicated how a games\u2019s score changed from one time step to\nthe next: +1 whenever it increased, \u22121 whenever it decreased, and 0 otherwise. This\nstandardized the reward signal across the games and made a single step-size parameter\nwork well for all the games despite their varying ranges of scores. DQN used an \"-greedy\npolicy, with \" decreasing linearly over the \ufb01rst million frames and remaining at a low\nvalue for the rest of the learning session. The values of the various other parameters,\nsuch as the learning step size, discount rate, and others speci\ufb01c to the implementation,\nwere selected by performing informal searches to see which values worked best for a small\nselection of the games. These values were then held \ufb01xed for all of the games.\nAfter DQN selected an action, the action was executed by the game emulator, which\nreturned a reward and the next video frame. The frame was preprocessed and added\nto the four-frame stack that became the next input to the network. Skipping for the\nmoment the changes to the basic Q-learning procedure made by Mnih et al., DQN used\nthe following semi-gradient form of Q-learning to update the network\u2019s weights:\nwt+1 = wt + \u21b5\nh\nRt+1 + \u03b3 max\na\n\u02c6q(St+1, a, wt) \u2212\u02c6q(St, At, wt)\ni\nr\u02c6q(St, At, wt), (16.3)\nwhere wt is the vector of the network\u2019s weights, At is the action selected at time step t,\nand St and St+1 are respectively the preprocessed image stacks input to the network at\ntime steps t and t + 1.\nThe gradient in (16.3) was computed by backpropagation.
